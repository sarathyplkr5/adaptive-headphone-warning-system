So ,what does our system do?

Say your at home listening to some heavy metal music on your headphones, and someone calls out your name.You couldn’t possibly hear that person.Our system (prototype) reduces the volume of your headphones .Thus you realize something requires your attention and you can look around .Our system is adaptive in the sense it works in surroundings with completely different ambient noise levels.For example: at home and at a traffic signal

What we hope it does in the next year or so?…

Recognize only your name(you don’t want the volume reduced when someone else’s name is called)
Recognize the person calling you
Triangulate his/her position and “tell you”
